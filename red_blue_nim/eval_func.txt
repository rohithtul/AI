Eval Function:

The evaluation function get score(red, blue) used in the presented program is a straightforward heuristic that awards points for the game's current condition based on the number of marbles still in play. The function assigns weights of 2 to red marbles and 3 to blue marbles. If a pile is empty, the function returns the score based on the remaining marbles.In states with more red marbles still present, the score is greater; in states with more blue marbles still present, the score is higher still. The function also takes into account the possibility of one of the piles being empty and awards points accordingly.
  As it encapsulates the goal of the game—having as many marbles as possible at the end—this heuristic evaluation function is straightforward but successful in this instance. More points are given to states that are more likely to win, while lower points are given to states that are more likely to lose. Since Red-Blue Nim and other games with constrained and well-defined state spaces benefit from this strategy, it is frequently used in board games.
  Despite the possibility of other, more complex evaluation methods, the provided function is appropriate for this straightforward game and is computationally effective. This game's objective is simple and easy to specify, hence a complex evaluation function is not necessary. The heuristic function is simple and improves the performance and efficiency of the program.
